Here some solutions for Python **decorators and iterators** Tasks using `os`, `dataclasses`, and `functools` modules.

## Task1. Class MyDict

- create a derivative class of a regular dictionary, with the exception of iteration giving both keys and values

## Task2. Yield, or not to Yield

- create function that appends new element to the list iterator returning iterator

## Task3. Classes MyString an MySet

- create decorator for class methods to return current class objects 

## Task4. Form public to private, and vice versa

- replace all public methods to private, and vice versa, using decorator `switch_privacy()`

## Task5. Context manager OpenFasta

- create context manager for reading .fasta files and storing them in dataclass `FastaRecord()` format

## Task6. Crossbreed them all!

- get all possible (non-unique) genotypes when crossbreeding two organisms and calculate the probability of a certain genotype (its expected share in the offspring)

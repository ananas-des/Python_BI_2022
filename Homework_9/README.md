# Homework9

Here some solutions for Python **object oriented programming (OOP)** Tasks using `datetime`, `abc`, and `numpy` modules.

### System
This code was tested on **Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS** with **Python version 3.10.6**.

### Files
In this directory there are *four files*: [README.md](./README.md), [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt), [hw9_oop.ipynb](./hw9_oop.ipynb), and [hw9_oop.py](./hw9_oop.py).

- **README.md**: discriptions for files in this directory
- **requirements.txt**: .txt file with the dependencies for *hw9_oop.ipynb* and *.py* 
- **hw9_oop.ipynb**: jupyter notebook with Tasks solutions
- **hw9_oop.py**: .py with only code from jupyter notebook

## Task1. Chat, Message and User

- create classes `Chat`, `Message`, and `User` for sending messages to chat and retrieving their information

## Task2. Args

- create class `Args` to call function via specific syntax

## Task3. StrangeFloat

- create subclass `StrangeFloat` derived from `float`

## Task4. More Dunders!
